Electricity and heat are dangerous! Evaluate the risk and make go no go decision!

Web-based Raspberry Pi Kiln Control:
- achieved my goal to run on Rasberry Pi Zero W, but I am currently firing on a Raspberry Pi 3b: 
	+ sqlite3 database for firing profiles and logging (small memory footprint)
	+ lighttpd web server (small memory footprint)

- kiln sitter(KS) as a sensor
	+ KS functions as 'ARMED', can not start firing without kilnsitter being armed
	+ set profile top temp higher than KS cone, KS is intended trigger, thermocouple is safety

Future improvements:
- performance watchdog:
	+ warning notifications, klexting;
	+ shutdown when a minimum rate cannot be maintained,
- inductive current sensors: element fault indication;
- crash/loss of power recovery:
	+ PI comes up, KS is armed & profile is 'Running' then how to consider unfinished segment
	+ compare temp at the timestamp to current temp
	+ compare last timestamp of 'Running' firing to current time
	+ notify on power resume, klexting (kiln text message)

- Current kiln controller is attached to is a Old Skutt 281, which is a previous model number of KS1027:
  + old elements, I am surprised that it easily reaches temp at a reasonable rate, this kiln sat unused, outside under roof for 15 years;
  + lid(split and flaking)repaired/coated;
  + base(cracks) repaired;
  + rust removal on controller boxes, painted;
  + built rolling stand out of 2"x3" mild steel rectangular tube;

		Or, on the controller RPi, http://localhost/pilnapp/home.cgi

- Start the firing daemon:

		python3 /home/pi/PiLN/daemon/pilnfired.py

- PID with C algorithm:

      This is a work in progress and I have not finish testing these instructions;
      My implementation of a PID algorithm that is optimized for a system that can only add heat;

      Kc is not determined by a time sensitive value;
      Ki is not time sensitive;
      Kp & Kd are determined by an amount of error over a time segment 
          these terms should be normalized by the time segment like (term*60/window)
      
      Cterm = Kc/100 * (Current_temp - room_temp);
      Window = determined by bump test, mine is 30 seconds
      error = Setpoint - Currrent_temp;
      Pterm = Kp * 60/Window * error;
      Iterm = Summation (Ki * error), constrained by (Imin <= Iterm <= Imax);
      Dterm = Kd * 60/Window * (error - previous_error);
      output = (Cterm + Pterm + Iterm + Dterm) constrained by (0 <= output <= 100);

      Window:
          Size of the base time unit, the controller will decide what to do every window;
          based on the response time of the kiln (how long it takes to finish reacting to input);
          my kiln window = 30;
          bump test

              turning on kiln for 30 seconds
              record time/temp every 10 seconds until temp starts falling
              tau_temp = .75 * (hi_temp - start_temp)
              window = .25 * (time of tau_temp)

      Cterm:

          Kc = 6;
          steady state term, required amount of energy to maintain temp;
          linear, inverse proportional to r-value of kiln;
          my kiln requires about 6% of output per 100C of temp differential;
          (100C ~= 6% to hold temp, 1000C ~= 60% to hold temp);
          tune:
              after determining "window", do a test run to 500C, with a 10 minute hold every 100C;
              query the database to find the average output during the holds;
              mine was about 6% per 100C.

      Pterm:

          Kp = 3;
          proportional to desired change in temp;
          TODO - test runs with rate 60 and 166 C/hr, query the database and average(pid_output-Pterm) for each 100C segment.

      Iterm:
          
          Ki = 0.4;
          Imin = -25;
          Imax = 25;
          Imax and Imin are hard coded, may need to make tunable or auto-adjusted based on temp and/or temp climb rate;
          accumlitive error correction of Cterm + Pterm;
          to reduce "Iterm Windup", limit with (Imin <= Iterm <+ Imax).

      Dterm:

          Kd = 13;
          change in error;
          Dterm is the acceleration term.
          it allows time for Iterm to wind up or down, to keep from falling behind or over shooting.

      output:

          output = (Cterm + Pterm + Iterm + Dterm);
          output is a percentage and therefore needs to be constrained by (0 <= output <= 100)
