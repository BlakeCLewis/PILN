Electricity and heat are dangerous! Evaluate the risk and make go no go decision!

Web-based Raspberry Pi Kiln Control:
- achieved my goal to run on Rasberry Pi Zero W, but I am currently running on a Raspberry Pi 3b: 
	+ sqlite3 instead of MySQL
	+ lighttpd instead of apache2 (apache memory was 1/2 pi zero memory, lighttpd does not even show up in top)
	+ on a Pi Zero W 'startx chromium-browser --start-maximized' (chrome in X with no window manager)
    + or hit it with browser from other machine on your network
    + I run full desktop on Pi 3b

- kiln sitter(KS) as a sensor
	+ KS functions as 'ARMED', can not start firing without kilnsitter being armed
	+ mode 1: set top temp lower than KS cone, thermocouple temp is shutoff trigger, KS is safety
	+ mode 2: set top temp higher than KS cone, KS is shutoff trigger, thermocouple is safety

Future improvements:
- record ambient temp with firing data:
- thermocouple class:
	+ MAX31855 current harware,
	+ MAX31856 has 50/60hz filter and a correction table and can do multiple types including S, minimal change
- performance watchdog:
	+ warning notifications, klexting;
	+ shutdown when a minimum rate cannot be maintained,
- inductive current sensors: element fault indication;
- zone control: thermocouple/section and control sections independently;
- crash/loss of power recovery:
	+ PI comes up, KS is armed & profile is 'Running' then how to consider unfinished segment
	+ compare temp at the timestamp to current temp
	+ compare last timestamp of 'Running' firing to current time
	+ notify on power resume, klexting (kiln text message)

- Current kiln controller is attached to is a Old Skutt 281, which is a previous model number of KS1027:
  + old elements, I am surprised that it easily reaches temp at high speed, this kiln sat unused, outside under roof for 15 years, I don't want to put my new elements in it;
  + lid(split and flaking)repaired/coated;
  + base(cracks) repaired;
  + rust removal on controller boxes, painted;
  + built 2 steel rolling stands;

- PID with C algorithm:

      This is a work in progress and I have not finish testing these instructions;
      My implementation of a PID algorithm that is optimaized for a system that can only add heat;

      Short comings:

          As presented, a change in window size will affect the P,I,D constants;
          I am working on a version scales with window size to reduce the affect of changing window size;
          C is not determined by a time sensitive value;
          P,I & D are determined by an amount of error over a time segment
              these terms should be normilazed by the time segment like (term*60/window)
      
      error = Setpoint - Currrent_temp;
      Pterm = Kp * error;
      Iterm = Summation (Ki * error), constrained by (Imin <= Iterm <= Imax);
      Dterm = Kd (error - previous_error);
      Cterm = Kc * (Current_temp - room_temp)/100;
      Window = determinied by bump test.

      Window:
          size of the base time unit, the controller will decide what to every window;
          is determined by kiln response time (how long it takes to finish reacting to input);
          window = 30;
          bump test

              turning on kiln for 30 seconds
              record temp/time every 10 seconds
              tau_temp = .75(hi_temp - start-temp)
              window = 1/4 (time at tau+temp)

      Cterm:

          Kc = 6;
          Steady state term, required amount of energy to maintain temp;
          it is linear, inverse proportional to r-value of kiln;
          this is my solution to the oscillating I could not tune out of PID;
          it probably is not an original thought;
          my kiln requires about 6% of output per 100C of temp differential;
          (100C ~= 6% to hold temp, 1000C ~= 60% to hold temp);
          tune:
              after determining "window", do a test run to 500C, with 10 minute holds every 100C;
              query the database to find the average output during the holds;
              mine was about 6% per 100C.

      Pterm:

          Kp = 5;
          An amount proportional to desired change in temp;
          this was an intuitive gues that worked

      Iterm:

          Ki = 1;
          Imin = -25;
          Imax = 25;
          Accumlitive error, corrects for past errors in (Cterm + Pterm);
          I look at it as incremental change in output to correct for error of (Cterm + Pterm);
          To reduce iIterm "Windup", Iterm is limited by (Imin <= Iterm <+ Imax).

      Dterm:

          Kd = 25;
          rate of change in error, d;
          Dterm needs to beable to cancel Item, another intuitive guess.

      Output:

          output = (Cterm + Pterm + Iterm + Dterm);
          output is a percentage and therefore constrained by (0 <= output <= 100)
